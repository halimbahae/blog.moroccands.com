# [Data Scraping](https://hashnode.com/draft/65bccc56d821d9fd24722c81#heading-datascraping)

In the realm of real estate analytics, data is king. But how do we access this treasure trove of information scattered across the vast expanse of the internet? Enter web scraping ‚Äì the digital prospector's tool of choice.

**What is Web Scraping?**

Web scraping is the art of extracting data from websites, allowing us to collect valuable information for analysis and insights. In the context of our project, web scraping enables us to gather real estate listings, economic indicators, and other pertinent data from online sources.

**Why is it Important?**

In the dynamic world of real estate, having access to up-to-date and comprehensive data is crucial for making informed decisions. Web scraping empowers us to gather vast amounts of data efficiently, giving us a competitive edge in predicting real estate prices and understanding market trends.

**Scraping Data from Mubawab with BeautifulSoup**

Our journey begins with [Mubawab](https://www.mubawab.ma/), a prominent real estate website in Morocco, brimming with valuable listings and insights. Using the Python library BeautifulSoup, we embark on our quest to extract data from Mubawab with precision and finesse.

**The Process**:

*Exploration*: We start by inspecting the structure of the Mubawab website, identifying the key elements containing the data we seek ‚Äì from property listings to pricing information.

*Scripting*: Armed with our knowledge of HTML and CSS, we craft Python scripts leveraging BeautifulSoup to navigate through the website's code and extract the desired data.

*Extraction*: With surgical precision, our scripts traverse through the pages of Mubawab, capturing essential details such as property names, prices, locations, area, and more.

*Aggregation:* As the data flows in, we gather and organize it into structured formats such as Excel spreadsheets, ready for further analysis and processing.

**Python Code Snippets:**

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import pandas as pd
from urllib.parse import urlparse, urljoin

# Define the base URL of Mubawab
baseurl = 'https://www.mubawab.ma/'

# Set to store unique product links
product_links = set()

# Loop through multiple pages of apartment listings
for page_num in range(1, 3):
    # Make a GET request to the page
    r = requests.get(f'https://www.mubawab.ma/fr/sc/appartements-a-vendre:p:{page_num}')
    soup = BeautifulSoup(r.content, 'html.parser')

   # Extract listings from the page
    listings = soup.find_all(class_='listingBox w100')

    # Loop through each listing and extract product links
    for listing in listings:
        links = listing.find_all('a', href=True)
        for link in links:
            product_link = link['href']

            # Check if the URL is valid
            if not urlparse(product_link).scheme:
                product_link = urljoin(baseurl, product_link)
                product_links.add(product_link)  # Add link to the set

# Initialize list to store scraped data
scraped_data = []

# Loop through each product link and scrape data
for link in product_links:
    try:
        # Make a GET request to the product page
        r = requests.get(link)
        soup = BeautifulSoup(r.content)
        # Extract relevant information from the page
        # (Code snippet continued from previous section...)
    except Exception as e:
        print('Error processing page:', link)
        print(e)
        continue

# Convert scraped data to DataFrame and save to Excel
df = pd.DataFrame(scraped_data)
df.to_excel('mubawab_data.xlsx', index=False)
```

With web scraping as our trusty pickaxe, we delve into the digital mines of Mubawab, extracting nuggets of real estate data to fuel our predictive models and illuminate the path to informed decision-making. Let the data adventure begin! üè†üíª

# [Data Cleaning](https://hashnode.com/draft/65bccc56d821d9fd24722c81#heading-datascleaning)

**Why Data Cleaning Matters:**

Before we can uncover the hidden patterns and insights within our data, we must first ensure its integrity and quality. Data cleaning plays a pivotal role in this process, serving as the foundation upon which our analyses and models are built. By removing inconsistencies, handling missing values, and standardizing formats, we pave the way for accurate and reliable results.

**Steps in Data Cleaning:**

Removing Duplicates: Duplicate entries can skew our analyses and lead to erroneous conclusions. By identifying and eliminating duplicates, we ensure that each observation contributes meaningfully to our insights.

Handling Missing Values: Missing data is a common challenge in real-world datasets. Whether due to human error or system limitations, missing values must be addressed to maintain the integrity of our analyses. Strategies such as imputation or removal can be employed based on the nature and context of the missing data.

Standardizing Data Types: Inconsistent data types can impede our ability to perform meaningful calculations and comparisons. Standardizing data types ensures uniformity and facilitates seamless data manipulation and analysis.

**Python Code Snippets:**

```python

# Load the scraped data after some cleaning with VBA Macros

df = pd.read_excel('mubawab_data.xlsx')

# Remove duplicate rows

df.drop_duplicates(inplace=True)

# Drop rows with missing prices

df.dropna(subset=['price'], inplace=True)

# Fill missing values in 'city' with corresponding values from 'secteur'

df['city'].fillna(df['secteur'], inplace=True)

# Fill missing values in 'sdb' and 'chambres' with the mean

mean_sdb = df['sdb'].mean()

mean_chambres = df['chambres'].mean()

mean_surface = df['surface'].mean()

df['sdb'].fillna(mean_sdb, inplace=True)

df['chambres'].fillna(mean_chambres, inplace=True)

df['surface'].fillna(mean_surface, inplace=True)

# Fill missing values in 'pieces' with the sum of 'sdb' and 'chambres'

df['pieces'].fillna(df['sdb'] + df['chambres'], inplace=True)

# One-hot encode 'secteur' and 'city' columns

df = pd.get_dummies(df, columns=['secteur', 'city'])

# Display the cleaned DataFrame

print(df.head())
```

**Example:**
